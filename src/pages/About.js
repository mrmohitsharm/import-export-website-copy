                We are proud to have participated in Rising Rajasthan 2024, where we had the chance to showcase the beautiful craft of block printing. 
                It was a special moment for us to stand alongside my father, Shri Awdhesh Kumar Pandey, and share this traditional art form with the Honorable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Block printing is more than just a craft — it is a part of our heritage, passed down through generations. 
                My father has dedicated his life to preserving this art, and it was an honor to represent his efforts and the work of skilled artisans who keep this tradition alive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our aim is to celebrate and promote the rich culture of Rajasthan through our hand block printed designs. 
                This opportunity inspires us to continue sharing this unique art with the world while supporting the talented hands behind it.
