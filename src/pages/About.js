        The world famous Sanganeri print known for its exquisite Hand Block print fabrics and azo free and
        natural dyes. We belong to traditional hand block printing community. In 1940's Shri Harnath ji and their
        son Shri Balchand ji Pandey started hand block printing and sell products like dupattas and Fadat (fabric)
        in local road side 'Hatwara' (local market) in Jaipur and to community people by the name of "Balji
        Harnath Hala" by putting their name on each piece for uniqueness and authenticity of their products.
        Their Son Shri Ram Kishore ji Pandey started the company "Ram Kishore Awdhesh Kumar" in 1971 to
        sell our products to government emporium and other companies. After that, their son Awdhesh Pandey
        continued their legacy and expanded by starting "A.K. International" for export query and "A.K.Textiles"
        for domestic query, in 1994, then in the continuation Awdhesh Pandey's younger son Khushiram Pandey
        started the brand <b>"Awdhesh Kumar"</b> in 2012 after his design studies, to expand in retail business.
        <br /><br />
        We chose to revive and revitalize our Ancestral work by our innovative approach and the inherited skill in
        hand block printing and vegetable Dyeing.
        <br />
        We are working with different printing and dyeing techniques such as Syahi Beggar Printing, Dabu
